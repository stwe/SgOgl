# Introduction

Reflection (or rather, its lack) is a trending topic in the C++ world and, in
the specific case of `EnTT`, a tool that can unlock a lot of other features. I
looked for a third-party library that met my needs on the subject, but I always
came across some details that I didn't like: macros, being intrusive, too many
allocations. In one word: unsatisfactory.<br/>
I finally decided to write a built-in, non-intrusive and macro-free runtime
reflection system for `EnTT`. Maybe I didn't do better than others or maybe yes,
time will tell me, but at least I can model this tool around the library to
which it belongs and not vice versa.

# Names and identifiers

The meta system doesn't force the user to use the tools provided by the library
when it comes to working with names and identifiers. It does this by offering an
API that works with opaque identifiers that may or may not be generated by means
of a hashed string.<br/>
This means that users can assign any type of identifier to the meta objects, as
long as they are numeric. It doesn't matter if they are generated at runtime, at
compile-time or with custom functions.

However, the examples in the following sections are all based on the
`hashed_string` class as provided by this library. Therefore, where an
identifier is required, it's likely that a user defined literal is used as
follows:

```cpp
auto factory = entt::reflect<my_type>("reflected_type"_hs);
```

For what it's worth, this is likely completely equivalent to:

```cpp
auto factory = entt::reflect<my_type>(42);
```

Obviously, human-readable identifiers are more convenient to use and highly
recommended.

# Reflection in a nutshell

Reflection always starts from real types (users cannot reflect imaginary types
and it would not make much sense, we wouldn't be talking about reflection
anymore).<br/>
To _reflect_ a type, the library provides the `reflect` function:

```cpp
auto factory = entt::reflect<my_type>("reflected_type"_hs);
```

It accepts the type to reflect as a template parameter and an optional
identifier as an argument. Identifiers are important because users can retrieve
meta types at runtime by searching for them by _name_. However, there are cases
in which users can be interested in adding features to a reflected type so that
the reflection system can use it correctly under the hood, but they don't want
to allow searching the type by _name_.<br/>
In both cases, the returned value is a factory object to use to continue
building the meta type.

A factory is such that all its member functions returns the factory itself.
It can be used to extend the reflected type and add the following:

* _Constructors_. Actual constructors can be assigned to a reflected type by
  specifying their list of arguments. Free functions (namely, factories) can be
  used as well, as long as the return type is the expected one. From a client's
  point of view, nothing changes if a constructor is a free function or an
  actual constructor.<br/>
  Use the `ctor` member function for this purpose:

  ```cpp
  entt::reflect<my_type>("reflected"_hs).ctor<int, char>().ctor<&factory>();
  ```

* _Destructors_. Free functions can be set as destructors of reflected types.
  The purpose is to give users the ability to free up resources that require
  special treatment before an object is actually destroyed.<br/>
  Use the `dtor` member function for this purpose:

  ```cpp
  entt::reflect<my_type>("reflected"_hs).dtor<&destroy>();
  ```

  A function should neither delete nor explicitly invoke the destructor of a
  given instance.

* _Data members_. Both real data members of the underlying type and static and
  global variables, as well as constants of any kind, can be attached to a meta
  type. From a client's point of view, all the variables associated with the
  reflected type will appear as if they were part of the type itself.<br/>
  Use the `data` member function for this purpose:

  ```cpp
  entt::reflect<my_type>("reflected"_hs)
      .data<&my_type::static_variable>("static"_hs)
      .data<&my_type::data_member>("member"_hs)
      .data<&global_variable>("global"_hs);
  ```

  This function requires as an argument the identifier to give to the meta data
  once created. Users can then access meta data at runtime by searching for them
  by _name_.<br/>
  Data members can be set also by means of a couple of functions, namely a
  setter and a getter. Setters and getters can be either free functions, member
  functions or mixed ones, as long as they respect the required signatures.<br/>
  Refer to the inline documentation for all the details.

* _Member functions_. Both real member functions of the underlying type and free
  functions can be attached to a meta type. From a client's point of view, all
  the functions associated with the reflected type will appear as if they were
  part of the type itself.<br/>
  Use the `func` member function for this purpose:

  ```cpp
  entt::reflect<my_type>("reflected"_hs)
      .func<&my_type::static_function>("static"_hs)
      .func<&my_type::member_function>("member"_hs)
      .func<&free_function>("free"_hs);
  ```

  This function requires as an argument the identifier to give to the meta
  function once created. Users can then access meta functions at runtime by
  searching for them by _name_.

* _Base classes_. A base class is such that the underlying type is actually
  derived from it. In this case, the reflection system tracks the relationship
  and allows for implicit casts at runtime when required.<br/>
  Use the `base` member function for this purpose:

  ```cpp
  entt::reflect<derived_type>("derived"_hs).base<base_type>();
  ```

  From now on, wherever a `base_type` is required, an instance of `derived_type`
  will also be accepted.

* _Conversion functions_. Actual types can be converted, this is a fact. Just
  think of the relationship between a `double` and an `int` to see it. Similar
  to bases, conversion functions allow users to define conversions that will be
  implicitly performed by the reflection system when required.<br/>
  Use the `conv` member function for this purpose:

  ```cpp
  entt::reflect<double>().conv<int>();
  ```

That's all, everything users need to create meta types and enjoy the reflection
system. At first glance it may not seem that much, but users usually learn to
appreciate it over time.<br/>
Also, do not forget what these few lines hide under the hood: a built-in,
non-intrusive and macro-free system for reflection in C++. Features that are
definitely worth the price, at least for me.

## Any as in any type

The reflection system comes with its own meta any type. It may seem redundant
since C++17 introduced `std::any`, but it is not.<br/>
In fact, the _type_ returned by an `std::any` is a const reference to an
`std::type_info`, an implementation defined class that's not something everyone
wants to see in a software. Furthermore, the class `std::type_info` suffers from
some design flaws and there is even no way to _convert_ an `std::type_info` into
a meta type, thus linking the two worlds.

A meta any object provides an API similar to that of its most famous counterpart
and serves the same purpose of being an opaque container for any type of
value.<br/>
It minimizes the allocations required, which are almost absent thanks to _SBO_
techniques. In fact, unless users deal with _fat types_ and create instances of
them though the reflection system, allocations are at zero.

A meta any object can be created by any other object or as an empty container
to initialize later:

```cpp
// a meta any object that contains an int
entt::meta_any any{0};

// an empty meta any object
entt::meta_any empty{};
```

It takes the burden of destroying the contained instance when required.<br/>
Moreover, it can be used as an opaque container for unmanaged objects if needed:

```cpp
int value;
entt::meta_any any{entt::as_alias, value};
```

In this case, the contained instance is never destroyed and users must ensure
that the lifetime of the object exceeds that of the container.

A meta any object has a `type` member function that returns the meta type of the
contained value, if any. The member functions `try_cast`, `cast` and `convert`
are used to know if the underlying object has a given type as a base or if it
can be converted implicitly to it.

## Enjoy the runtime

Once the web of reflected types has been constructed, it's a matter of using it
at runtime where required.<br/>
All this has the great merit that, unlike the vast majority of the things
present in this library and closely linked to the compile-time, the reflection
system stands in fact as a non-intrusive tool for the runtime.

To search for a reflected type there are two options: by type or by _name_. In
both cases, the search can be done by means of the `resolve` function:

```cpp
// search for a reflected type by type
auto by_type = entt::resolve<my_type>();

// search for a reflected type by name
auto by_name = entt::resolve("reflected_type"_hs);
```

There exits also a third overload of the `resolve` function to use to iterate
all the reflected types at once:

```cpp
resolve([](auto type) {
    // ...
});
```

In all cases, the returned value is an instance of `meta_type`. This type of
objects offer an API to know the _runtime identifier_ of the type, to iterate
all the meta objects associated with them and even to build or destroy instances
of the underlying type.<br/>
Refer to the inline documentation for all the details.

The meta objects that compose a meta type are accessed in the following ways:

* _Meta constructors_. They are accessed by types of arguments:

  ```cpp
  auto ctor = entt::resolve<my_type>().ctor<int, char>();
  ```

  The returned type is `meta_ctor` and may be invalid if there is no constructor
  that accepts the supplied arguments or at least some types from which they are
  derived or to which they can be converted.<br/>
  A meta constructor offers an API to know the number of arguments, the expected
  meta types and to invoke it, therefore to construct a new instance of the
  underlying type.

* _Meta destructor_. It's returned by a dedicated function:

  ```cpp
  auto dtor = entt::resolve<my_type>().dtor();
  ```

  The returned type is `meta_dtor` and may be invalid if there is no custom
  destructor set for the given meta type.<br/>
  All what a meta destructor has to offer is a way to invoke it on a given
  instance. Be aware that the result may not be what is expected.

* _Meta data_. They are accessed by _name_:

  ```cpp
  auto data = entt::resolve<my_type>().data("member"_hs);
  ```

  The returned type is `meta_data` and may be invalid if there is no meta data
  object associated with the given identifier.<br/>
  A meta data object offers an API to query the underlying type (ie to know if
  it's a const or a static one), to get the meta type of the variable and to set
  or get the contained value.

* _Meta functions_. They are accessed by _name_:

  ```cpp
  auto func = entt::resolve<my_type>().func("member"_hs);
  ```

  The returned type is `meta_func` and may be invalid if there is no meta
  function object associated with the given identifier.<br/>
  A meta function object offers an API to query the underlying type (ie to know
  if it's a const or a static function), to know the number of arguments, the
  meta return type and the meta types of the parameters. In addition, a meta
  function object can be used to invoke the underlying function and then get the
  return value in the form of meta any object.

* _Meta bases_. They are accessed through the _name_ of the base types:

  ```cpp
  auto base = entt::resolve<derived_type>().base("base"_hs);
  ```

  The returned type is `meta_base` and may be invalid if there is no meta base
  object associated with the given identifier.<br/>
  Meta bases aren't meant to be used directly, even though they are freely
  accessible. They expose only a few methods to use to know the meta type of the
  base class and to convert a raw pointer between types.

* _Meta conversion functions_. They are accessed by type:

  ```cpp
  auto conv = entt::resolve<double>().conv<int>();
  ```

  The returned type is `meta_conv` and may be invalid if there is no meta
  conversion function associated with the given type.<br/>
  The meta conversion functions are as thin as the meta bases and with a very
  similar interface. The sole difference is that they return a newly created
  instance wrapped in a meta any object when they convert between different
  types.

All the objects thus obtained as well as the meta types can be explicitly
converted to a boolean value to check if they are valid:

```cpp
auto func = entt::resolve<my_type>().func("member"_hs);

if(func) {
    // ...
}
```

Furthermore, all meta objects with the exception of meta destructors can be
iterated through an overload that accepts a callback through which to return
them. As an example:

```cpp
entt::resolve<my_type>().data([](auto data) {
    // ...
});
```

A meta type can also be used to `construct` or `destroy` actual instances of the
underlying type.<br/>
In particular, the `construct` member function accepts a variable number of
arguments and searches for a match. It returns a `meta_any` object that may or
may not be initialized, depending on whether a suitable constructor has been
found or not. On the other side, the `destroy` member function accepts instances
of `meta_any` as well as actual objects by reference and invokes the registered
destructor if any.<br/>
Be aware that the result of a call to `destroy` may not be what is expected. The
purpose is to give users the ability to free up resources that require special
treatment and **not** to actually destroy instances.

Meta types and meta objects in general contain much more than what is said: a
plethora of functions in addition to those listed whose purposes and uses go
unfortunately beyond the scope of this document.<br/>
I invite anyone interested in the subject to look at the code, experiment and
read the official documentation to get the best out of this powerful tool.

## Policies: the more, the less

Policies are a kind of compile-time directives that can be used when recording
reflection information.<br/>
Their purpose is to require slightly different behavior than the default in some
specific cases. For example, when reading a given data member, its value is
returned wrapped in a `meta_any` object which, by default, makes a copy of it.
For large objects or if the caller wants to access the original instance, this
behavior isn't desirable. Policies are there to offer a solution to this and
other problems.

There are a few alternatives available at the moment:

* The _as-is_ policy, associated with the type `entt::as_is_t`.<br/>
  This is the default policy. In general, it should never be used explicitly,
  since it's implicitly selected if no other policy is specified.<br/>
  In this case, the return values of the functions as well as the properties
  exposed as data members are always returned by copy in a dedicated wrapper and
  therefore associated with their original meta types.

* The _as-void_ policy, associated with the type `entt::as_void_t`.<br/>
  Its purpose is to discard the return value of a meta object, whatever it is,
  thus making it appear as if its type were `void`.<br/>
  If the use with functions is obvious, it must be said that it's also possible
  to use this policy with constructors and data members. In the first case, the
  constructor will be invoked but the returned wrapper will actually be empty.
  In the second case, instead, the property will not be accessible for
  reading.

  As an example of use:

  ```cpp
  entt::reflect<my_type>("reflected"_hs)
      .func<&my_type::member_function, entt::as_void_t>("member"_hs);
  ```

* The _as-alias_ policy, associated with the type `entt::as_alias_t`.<br/>
  It allows to build wrappers that act as aliases for the objects used to
  initialize them. Modifying the object contained in the wrapper for which the
  _aliasing_ was requested will make it possible to directly modify the instance
  used to initialize the wrapper itself.<br/>
  This policy works with constructors (for example, when objects are taken from
  an external container rather than created on demand), data members and
  functions in general (as long as their return types are lvalue references).

  As an example of use:

  ```cpp
  entt::reflect<my_type>("reflected"_hs)
      .data<&my_type::data_member, entt::as_alias_t>("member"_hs);
  ```

Some uses are rather trivial, but it's useful to note that there are some less
obvious corner cases that can in turn be solved with the use of policies.

## Named constants and enums

A special mention should be made for constant values and enums. It wouldn't be
necessary, but it will help distracted readers.

As mentioned, the `data` member function can be used to reflect constants of any
type among the other things.<br/>
This allows users to create meta types for enums that will work exactly like any
other meta type built from a class. Similarly, arithmetic types can be enriched
with constants of special meaning where required.<br/>
Personally, I find it very useful not to export what is the difference between
enums and classes in C++ directly in the space of the reflected types.

All the values thus exported will appear to users as if they were constant data
members of the reflected types.

Exporting constant values or elements from an enum is as simple as ever:

```cpp
entt::reflect<my_enum>()
        .data<my_enum::a_value>("a_value"_hs)
        .data<my_enum::another_value>("another_value"_hs);

entt::reflect<int>().data<2048>("max_int"_hs);
```

It goes without saying that accessing them is trivial as well. It's a matter of
doing the following, as with any other data member of a meta type:

```cpp
auto value = entt::resolve<my_enum>().data("a_value"_hs).get({}).cast<my_enum>();
auto max = entt::resolve<int>().data("max_int"_hs).get({}).cast<int>();
```

As a side note, remember that all this happens behind the scenes without any
allocation because of the small object optimization performed by the meta any
class.

## Properties and meta objects

Sometimes (for example, when it comes to creating an editor) it might be useful
to be able to attach properties to the meta objects created. Fortunately, this
is possible for most of them.<br/>
To attach a property to a meta object, no matter what as long as it supports
properties, it is sufficient to provide an object at the time of construction
such that `std::get<0>` and `std::get<1>` are valid for it. In other terms, the
properties are nothing more than key/value pairs users can put in an
`std::pair`. As an example:

```cpp
entt::reflect<my_type>("reflected"_hs, std::make_pair("tooltip"_hs, "message"));
```

The meta objects that support properties offer then a couple of member functions
named `prop` to iterate them at once and to search a specific property by key:

```cpp
// iterate all the properties of a meta type
entt::resolve<my_type>().prop([](auto prop) {
    // ...
});

// search for a given property by name
auto prop = entt::resolve<my_type>().prop("tooltip"_hs);
```

Meta properties are objects having a fairly poor interface, all in all. They
only provide the `key` and the `value` member functions to be used to retrieve
the key and the value contained in the form of meta any objects, respectively.

## Unregister types

A type registered with the reflection system can also be unregistered. This
means unregistering all its data members, member functions, conversion functions
and so on. However, the base classes won't be unregistered, since they don't
necessarily depend on it. Similarly, implicitly generated types (as an example,
the meta types implicitly generated for function parameters when needed) won't
be unregistered.

To unregister a type, users can use the `unregister` function from the global
namespace:

```cpp
entt::unregister<my_type>();
```

This function returns a boolean value that is true if the type is actually
registered with the reflection system, false otherwise.<br/>
The type can be re-registered later with a completely different name and form.
